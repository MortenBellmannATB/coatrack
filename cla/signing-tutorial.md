# CoatRack CLA Signing Instructions

## Signing Instructions

When submitting a pull request for the first time, you will need to agree to the contributor license agreement (CLA). For example single, private persons must agree on the [CLA for individuals](https://github.com/coatrack/cla/latest/individual-cla.pdf) and organizations must agree on the [CLA for entities](https://github.com/coatrack/cla/latest/entity-cla.pdf). To do this, copy, rename and move [signing-template.md](https://github.com/coatrack/cla/signing-template.md) to `/cla/contributors/<your-github-username>.md`. Fill in the missing information, including the SHA-256 checksum of the corresponding CLA just mentioned, and add this file to your first pull request.



## Structure of the 'cla' folder

For transparency reasons, we will briefly explain here how our CLA was created and how the signing process works. 
Harmony provides [templates](http://harmonyagreements.org/agreements.html) for CLA's in ODT format which are stored in the [original](https://github.com/coatrack/cla/source/original) folder. Based on those templates we made custom versions, adapted to our CoatRack requirements, which are stored in the [customized](https://github.com/coatrack/cla/source/customized) folder. If you want to see the differences between the original and our customized version, you can easily compare the two ODT files (e.g. using LibreOffice). 

The customized CLA ODT's are converted to PDF's and stored in the [latest](https://github.com/coatrack/cla/latest) folder. These PDF files are the ones that have to be signed/hashed in order to be allowed to contribute to CoatRack.
