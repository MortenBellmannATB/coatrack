# Coatrack FIWARE reporting 
Reporting period: Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 (until 22-03-2021)

### Overview

Notably, during the reporting period coatrack got accepted as FIWARE incubator project, a fact the team is very happy about. The FIWARE adoption process has led to a series of mainly documentation changes, which has greatly improved the overall quality of the documentation. Some of the documentation still needs some extra attention as it currently mainly contains boilerplate.
